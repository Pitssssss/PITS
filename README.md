#Prelim Activity 02: Advanced Object-Oriented Programming and Robustness

Name: Peter Cayetano

Activity:
This lab bridges the gap between abstract architectural design and professional technical execution. Students will evolve from basic scripting to Systems Design by implementing the pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism, alongside robust Exception Handling.
